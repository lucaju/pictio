# PICT.IO

PICT. IO is based on the popular drawing game Pictionary, where players work together to solve drawing challenges. It is a guessing game where players try to identify objects that are drawn by their teammates. In PICT.IO, each team is composed of two humans and one machine, working in collaboration and communicating with limited resources, using drawings or speech, to solve visual challenges. The game’s system builds on Google’s Quick, Draw! that uses Machine Learning techniques to guess what players are drawing. PICT.IO is an online game that can be played on devices with a touchscreen, such as tablets and smartphones.
