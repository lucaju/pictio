            <p >This game provides humans and machine with a common problem to solve as teams, where players must make themselves understood through drawings.</p>
            <p><strong>Participants:</strong> 2 teams composed of 2 humans and 1 tablet.</p>
            <p><strong>Contents:</strong> 1 board, 1 dice, 1 frame and 2 pawns.</p>
            <p><strong>The goal of the game:</strong> Make the team's pawn the first to go all the way through the board.</p>
            <p>1. Each team chooses a pawn and places it at the beginning of the board.</p>
            <p>2. Each team selects one person to be the first drawer. The team players alternate the drawer at each round.</p>
            <p>3.	The first drawers of each team throw the dice and advance into the board, which provides them with the first challenge. There are three categories of challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A. Drawing on the Wall</li>
                <li>B. Blind Drawing with Left/ Right Hand</li>
                <li>C. Verbal Description</li>
            </ul>
            <p>4. The drawers can not use other means of communication rather than those indicated for each challenge.</p>
            <p>5. If the team is able to complete the challenge, they can throw the dice and play one more time. After that, it is the other teamâ€™s turn to throw the dice.</p>
            <p>6. The game continues this way until one of the pawns completes the entire course.</p>
